# Temporary fork of xiaokaike/vue-color
This package is meant to be a temporary fork that allows null values to be passed to color pickers. It is published to npm as `vue-color-nullable`. We will resume using the main package when the maintainers of [vue-color](https://github.com/xiaokaike/vue-color) merge [one of](https://github.com/xiaokaike/vue-color/pull/234) [the fixes](https://github.com/xiaokaike/vue-color/pull/228) for the issue.
